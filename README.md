A self-improving skill for AI coding agents. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, and any agent that reads an AGENTS.md / standing-instructions file.

Every session you do hard debugging or rediscover the same thing — how do I reach the prod DB? where do the creds live? what's the deploy command? how do I verify this live? — and that hard-won knowledge evaporates when the session ends. The next session starts from zero and re-learns it.

self-learning fixes that. It teaches your agent to recognize the moment it has just earned a reusable golden path and persist it where the tool will auto-load it next time — so the next session starts already knowing the route instead of rediscovering it.

It's a meta-skill: it doesn't do the work, it captures how the work got done — including the failures, since skipping a known dead-end next session is often worth more than the win itself.

The loop (same everywhere)
Recognize the moment — a task that only worked after several tries, a non-obvious command, a project fact you didn't know up front, an operational workflow likely to recur, or you simply saying "remember this".
Capture it, no prompt needed — it acts on the cue immediately, picks the scope/name itself, and tells you afterward. The procedure is captured (not a one-off answer), plus a "what didn't work" note.
Reuse — next session the entry loads automatically, by skill/rule description or because the instructions file is always read.
What differs per tool is only where knowledge is persisted and how it's auto-loaded:

Tool	Persists golden paths to	Auto-loads via
Claude Code, Codex, Agent Skills clients	a new skills/<name>/SKILL.md	skill description matching
Cursor	a new .cursor/rules/learned/<name>.mdc	rule description / globs
Zed, Aider, Gemini CLI, …	AGENTS.md (or project notes/memory)	always-read instructions
Install
npx — recommended (works with 70+ agents)
Uses the community skills CLI, which installs into whatever agents it detects — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, OpenCode, and more:

npx skills add kulaxyz/self-learning-skills                 # this project (auto-detects agents)
npx skills add kulaxyz/self-learning-skills -g              # global — all your projects
npx skills add kulaxyz/self-learning-skills -a claude-code  # a specific agent
Try it once without installing:

npx skills use kulaxyz/self-learning-skills --skill self-learning | claude
Claude Code plugin
/plugin marketplace add kulaxyz/self-learning-skills
/plugin install self-learning@self-learning-skills
Manual
Copy the files into place yourself
Triage: skill, memory, or skip?
It won't bloat your config with one-liners. Each lesson is routed:

Lesson	Where it goes
A multi-step, reusable procedure/workflow	a new skill / rule
A single fact or one-line correction	lightweight notes/memory (e.g. a MEMORY.md)
A genuine one-off	skipped
Promotion rule (don't enshrine guesses)
Triage decides granularity; the promotion rule decides confidence. A skill is authoritative — the next session trusts it without re-deriving it — so a session is only promoted to a skill when all three hold:

A passing check — the path was actually verified (a test passed, a clean exit, a green build, a reproduced repro). "Seemed to work" doesn't count.
A named failure pattern — the failure it avoids or diagnoses, named.
At least one ruled-out dead-end — a concrete approach tried and eliminated.
Miss any one and it stays a tentative memory note (or is skipped) rather than a skill. This keeps confident-but-unverified guesses out of the skill set. (Promotion rule suggested by community feedback.)

Safety
Harvested skills/rules get committed and shared, so this is built to never write secret values — no passwords, tokens, connection strings, or API keys. It records only where to find a secret (env var name, a client/selector function, an MCP tool, a secret manager). Reproducing a secret into a shared file leaks it.
